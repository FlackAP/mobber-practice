An exercise in HTML and CSS. This project was assigned to me in the Iron Yard Academy on the first day of class
and was completed by the end of the first week. The students were given a static .png image and told to duplicate
each line as a sort of sink-or-swim exercise. Despite a few quirks, I'm proud to call this the first website I've ever
constructed.
